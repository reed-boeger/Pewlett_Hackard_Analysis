# Pewlett Hackard Employee Retirement Analysis

## Purpose:

The purpose of this analysis, was a preemptive look into the expected large amount of retiring baby-boomer employees born between 1952 and 1956. The first analysis determines how many people are retiring for each title, which will be useful to know how to fill this positions. The second analysis was done to show how many employees are eligible for the mentorship program.

## Results:
- There are a very large number of  Senior Engineer's to backfill, more so than Engineer or Assitant Engineer titles this is to be expected since these employees are the most senior in age as well
- In the coming year the company will need to focus on finding replacements for senior positions and this cannot be done exclusively internally
- With the creation of the mentorship eligibility table, it will be very helpful to match these employees with less senior titles
- The senior employees can be organized further by sorting by from_date in the table to see who has held the positoin the longest.

## Summary:
- A total of 90,398 titles need to be filled, from counting the employee numbers in the retiring titles table. 
- After running a fast query to select the count of employees in the mentorship eligibility table, 1940 employees are eligible, this means on average each person needs to mentor 45.5 people, which does not sound feasible unless they were to become full-time lecturers.
